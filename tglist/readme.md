### What?
Just as the title says, this is a curated list of Facebook Groups and Pages for Translators, Interpreters and Other Language-Lovers. 

### Where?
[Here.](https://translatingcode.github.io/tglist/decider.html)

### Why?
Because it might help other people that were, just like me, searching for a certain group that is sharing their interests. 

### How?
HTML/Jquery/CSS

### How many groups?
On the 23<sup>rd</sup> of October the list contained 446 groups. 

### What can I find here?
Various groups ranging from college and universities to non-profit organisations.

### When is it updated?
The plan is to update it twice a month.

### Can I propose groups to be added?
Yup, [here.](https://github.com/TranslatingCode/translatingcode.github.io/issues/4)

### Hmmm, this code could look better.
I am well aware of that, will take care of that in the future.





### And now some nice graphics.
#### The dataset is not perfect. Please take this data with a grain of salt. The graphics are just here to help people better visualise the data.
##### Graphs were done using data from the 446 groups/resources available on the 23 <sup>rd</sup> of October.
